### Why this blog

When I learn, I generate a lot of notes, documentation and code, those often
just gather dust on my hard drive. My thought with this blog is that I can share
all my findings about subjects with the community.

### Who am I

My hometown currently is Nyk√∂ping, Sweden. Whenever I can I like to spend time
with friends and take (shopping) weekends in different cites. A passion I have is
to drive motocross, which I try to drive as much as I can. But driving motocross
isn't just about the driving (and repairing), you have to focus and look ahead,
just like when coding, and almost everything. You have to be several steps ahead
so you don't get surprised by what's behind the next corner.

When I not doing that, and not taking power walks, I code PowerShell.
I love PowerShell, but most of all the PowerShell community! I have the pleasure
and honor of collaborating with Microsoft PowerShell Team and contributors all
over the world in the effort to solve issues and improve the open source
xSQLServer PowerShell DSC resources.
I'm a maintainer for PowerShell DSC module
[xSQLServer](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer) and
[xFailOverCluster](https://github.com/PowerShell/xFailOverCluster).
For me as a maintainer it involves mostly administrative tasks, for example
answering issues, tagging issues, tagging pull requests, reviewing code, and
merging code. It also involves making sure the continuous integration process
works, try to help other contributors with any coding issues that arise.
Much of the time I dedicate to this maintainer role is spent maintaining, but
from time to time I also get time to improve the resources myself.

My day job is at D-data AB where I belong to the unit Business Development as a
Software Architect.
My focus areas are mostly integration and content management. My responsibilities
are, among other things, the life cycle of the software platforms. That the software
platforms are designed to meet the business needs in the short and long term, and
that the software fits and can be reused in the enterprise architecture.
