### Why this blog?

When I learn, I generate a lot of notes, documentation and code, those often
just gather dust on my hard drive. My thought with this blog is that I can share
all my findings about subjects with the community.


### Who am I?

My hometown currently is Nyk√∂ping, Sweden. Whenever I can like to spend time
with friends and take (shopping) weekends in different cites. A passion I have is
to drive motocross, which I try to drive as much as I can. But driving motocross
isn't jsyt abut the driving (and repairing), you have to focus and look ahead,
just like when coding, and most everything. You have to be steps ahead so you
don't get surprised in the next corner.

When I not doing that, and not taking power walks, I code PowerShell.
I love PowerShell, but most of all the PowerShell community! I have the pleasure
and honor of collaborating with Microsoft PowerShell Team and contributors all
over the world in the effort to solve issues and improve the open source
xSQLServer PowerShell DSC resources.
I'm a maintainer for PowerShell DSC module
[xSQLServer](https://github.com/PowerShell/xSQLServer) and
[xFailOverCluster](https://github.com/PowerShell/xFailOverCluster).
For me as a maintainer it involves mostly administrative tasks, for example
answering issues, tagging issues, tagging pull requests, reviewing code, and
merging code. It also involves making sure the continuous integration process
works, helping other contributors with any coding issues that arises, or they
get stuck.
Much of the time I dedicate to this maintainer role is spent maintaining, but
from time to time I also get time to improve the resources myself.

My day job is at D-data AB where I belong to the unit Business Development with
a role as Software Architect.
My focus area are mostly integration and content management. My responsible is,
among other things, the lifecycle of the software platforms. So the software
platforms is designed to meet the business needs in the short and long term, and
that it software fits and can be reused in the enterprise architecture.
